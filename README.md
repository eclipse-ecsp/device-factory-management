## Getting Started

To build the project in the local working directory after the project has been cloned/forked, run:

```mvn clean install```

from the command line interface.

### Prerequisites

The list of tools required to build and run the project:
   - Java 17
   - Maven

### Installation

[Install Java 17](https://www.azul.com/downloads/?version=java-17-lts&package=jdk#zulu)

[How to set up Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)

### Coding style check configuration

[checkstyle.xml](./device-factory-management-api/checkstyle.xml) is the coding standard to follow while writing new/updating existing
code.

Checkstyle plugin [maven-checkstyle-plugin:3.2.1](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-checkstyle-plugin/) is
integrated in [pom.xml](./pom.xml) which runs in the `validate` phase and `check` goal of the maven lifecycle and fails
the build if there are any checkstyle errors in the project.

To run checkstyle plugin explicitly, run the following command:
```mvn checkstyle:check```

### Running the tests

To run the tests for this system run the below maven command.

```mvn test```

Or run a specific test

```mvn test -Dtest="TheFirstUnitTest"```

To run a method from within a test

```mvn test -Dtest="TheSecondUnitTest#whenTestCase2_thenPrintTest2_1"```

### Deployment

1. The component can be deployed as a Kubernetes pod by installing Device factory management charts.

Link:
[Charts](../../../ecsp-helm-charts/tree/main/deviceinfoquery)

2. Postgres DB needs to be installed and ignite database/schema should be created with the required tables.

* Link of the database and table scripts to be installed:
  [dmpostgres.sql](../../../ecsp-helm-charts/blob/main/postgresql/db-scripts/dmpostgres.sql)

3. Detailed information about the request and response generated by
the [Device Factory Management APIs](https://eclipse-ecsp.github.io/ecsp-website/api-def/api-static-swagger.html#tag/device-controller).
